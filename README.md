# Credit Scoring Model – CodeAlpha Internship

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning-based **Credit Scoring Model** to predict whether a customer is **creditworthy** based on financial and personal attributes.

The project was completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build and evaluate ML models that classify customers as:
- **Creditworthy (1)**
- **Not Creditworthy (0)**

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📊 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

---
